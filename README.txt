3. Open the unzipped folder in an IDE of your choice. 

##Running the code
1. Open 'main.py'
2. Before running the python file to check the output, you must make sure you have the "nltk" library installed. If not, run the command "pip install -U nltk"
3. Once all the dependencies are installed, you can run the file by either clicking on the run button or running 
the command "python main.py" from where the main.py file is located.

##Output
- Upon compiling either the python project from main.py you can notice the "vsm_.txt" files getting populated. 
- vsm_title.txt has all the outputs generated from running the title setting.
- vsm_decription.txt has all the outputs generated from running the title + description setting.
- vsm_narrative.txt has all the outputs generated from running the title + narrative setting.
