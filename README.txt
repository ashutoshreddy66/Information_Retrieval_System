My code for Project Phase 1 is written using python. To execute the code, we must make sure python is installed within our systems
To install python, you can go to this website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and click on the Download button.
Before we run the code, make sure you unzip the folder in its entirity.
Open the unzipped folder in an IDE of your choice. 
Open the file main.py
Before running the python file to check the output, you must make sure you have the "nltk" library installed.
If not, run the command "pip install -U nltk"
Once all the dependencies are installed, you can run the file by either clicking on the run button or running 
the command "python main.py" from where the main.py file is located. 
Since the parser_output.txt file is already created, the data will be re-written into the same file.
