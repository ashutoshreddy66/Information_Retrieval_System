#Project Phase 2 README.

##Requirements
- Python 3.0 or later

##Installation
1. To install python, you can go to this website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and click on the Download button.
2. Unzip the entire folder
3. Open the unzipped folder in an IDE of your choice. 

##Running the code
1. Open 'main.py'
2. Before running the python file to check the output, you must make sure you have the "nltk" library installed. If not, run the command "pip install -U nltk"
3. Once all the dependencies are installed, you can run the file by either clicking on the run button or running 
the command "python main.py" from where the main.py file is located.

##Jupyter notebook(alternative execution)
1. Open 'main.ipynb' in jupyter/colab/vscode
2. Run all cells at once to see the output in the `parser_output.txt` file.

##Output
- Upon compiling either the python project from main.py or running all the cells using the main.ipynb file you will be able to find the outputs in forward_index.txt that stores all forward indices and inverted_index.txt that stores all inverted indices.
